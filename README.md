# PyWeek 8-Bit

A PyWeek video game, featuring:

## Digital Breedable Cockfighting Monsters

DBCM will be a turn based RPG with a "stance" system that will limit your
offensive and defensive actions from turn to turn and affect how effective your
moves will be.

It will also include a breedable element of unknown complexity. The goal is to
make the breeding effect the look of the creature and affect what kinds of
combat skills the creature should have.
